      - The (#) is the max number of points that subsection is worth
      - [X] X checkbox means full credit
      - [o] o checkbox means partial credit
      - [ ] empty checkbox means no credit
  - If your program does not run on the command line I cannot grade it.
  - Everyone will have the opportunity to resubmit either lab2 or lab3 later 
    this quarter
